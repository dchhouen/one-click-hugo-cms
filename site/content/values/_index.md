      Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its
      wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that
      provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides
      habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

      I give back 10% of my earnings profits into farms, local businesses and
      schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow
      and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
