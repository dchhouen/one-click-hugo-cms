    1-1 Coaching in-person, online


    The analysis of own games is a key element to achieve the objectives. Additionally I consider that the practice is as essential as learning and achieving a balance between both facets is extremely important, therefore part of the training consists of training games and their subsequent detailed analysis.

    I am always willing to listen to the particular interests of my students, therefore the training can be adapted to their specific needs.
